# 21 Days of Guitar ðŸŽ¸
*The one habit I have trouble committing to*  

`may-18 (day 1)` little talks, everlong, spider exercise (1234, 1324, 1342)  
`may-19 (day 2)` ðŸ¤¡  
`may-20 (day 3)` ðŸ¤¡  
`may-21 (day 4)` practiced for about 1 hour: intro / verse of everlong (foo fighters), spider exercise (1234, 1243) at 60bpm.  
`may-22 (day 5)` practiced for about 45 mins: Bsus2 to Gsus7 chord changes  first without metronome then at 15bpm before increasing to 20bpm for everlong, spider exercise at 60bpm then 65bpm, intro of stay together for the kids (blink 182). surprized my fingers still remember it. took care to take frequent breaks to shake away the tension in my fretting wrist. also paid attention to keeping a safe wrist position. played standing. had some nice encouragement from a musician coworker.  
`may-23 (day 6)` 10 mins of spider exercise (1234, 4321, 1324, 1423). another coworker proposed to lend me his metronome... before learning that it didn't belong to him so he returned it LOL. missed playing for the whole day. played standing.  
`may-24 (day 7)` more Bsus2 to Gsus7 chord changes at 25 bpm for everlong, Bm to D flying chord changes without metronome for the ecstasy once told (the dolly rocker movement). played sitting on bed.  
`may-25 (day 8)` slowly fingerpicked the main title of outer wilds with the metronome, starting again at every mistake (which were many). i had forgotten i wanted to try out the banjo! saw that the author of the tabs i've been using, riebeckguitar, has posted many more ((outer wilds)) sheets since the last time i checked out his channel and this makes me so happy! played for ~40 mins sitting on a chair, watching birds sleeping and sun ~~going supernova~~ rising.  
`may-26 (day 9)` more outer wilds main title at 60bpm, which in spite of all the mistakes, surprisingly came much more intuitively! played sitting at the dining table with low lights before ~~falling into a black hole~~ going to sleep. wondering what i could play when i stop trying to be a caricature of myself.  
`may-27 (day 10)` spider exercise at 60bpm, increasing to 70 then 80. bewildered to notice significant improvements?! sharper sense of rhythm, more consistent picking strength, better hands coordination... played sitting in bed, electric guitar unplugged, before going to sleep.
